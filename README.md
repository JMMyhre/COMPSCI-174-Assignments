# This is a repository for the course work included in COMPSCI 174

## COMPSCI 174 is an introductory course to C++

### All of this work was completed by myself

## Homework
HW 1: _This homework assignment, was our first in this course. It introduced basic input and output, as well as basic variables and operators._ 
- [Find it Here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/hw1.cpp)
 
HW 2: _This homework assignment has two parts. The first part is a basic income calculator, it takes in the amount of each type of seat at a sports game sold, and calculates the total income from the seats. The second part has a similar idea, it takes in the total number of tickets sold in a movie and calculates the gross profit for the box office as well as the distributor._ 
- Part 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/hw2_problem1.cpp)
- Part 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/hw2_problem2.cpp)

HW 3: _This homework assignment has two parts. The first part is a solution calculator for a specific equation, which only takes in positive integer values. The second part of this assignment was a first look at if else statements, and was used to output a result based on how many hours you worked out that week._

- Part 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/hw3_problem2.cpp)

HW 4: _This homework assignment was our first introduction to for loops as well as arrays. This homework assignment asks the user to input numbers for both of the arrays, then scans the arrays to see if they are the same._

HW 5:_This homework assignment was a way to introduce us to functions as well as nested for loops. In part 1 we have to create a specific pyramid pattern using nested for loops. While in part 2 we had to use a function to reverse a string that we got from user input._

## Labs

Lab 3:_This lab assignment has two parts. In the first part we coded a basic conversion calculator for US currency to Canadian currency. The second part uses similar features, but takes in the number of female and male students in a class and computes the percent female and percent male in the class_

- Part 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/lab3_task2.cpp)

Lab 4:_The first part to this lab assignment is a character converter, this was to get us used to how the character data type worked and how we could use it. The second part of this lab is a basic input output, the user puts in hours and the name of a gym and it outputs a statement_

Lab 5:_The first part of this lab calculates your total cost for an electric bill based on a users usage. The second part of this lab has the user input 3 numbers and gives back the largest one._

Lab 6:_This lab has three parts. In part one we ask the user for a positive number, and calculate whether that number is prime or not. In part two we take a number from the user and sum up the digits in the number. Finally in the third part we take and print all of the ascii numbers for the letters A-z._

- Part 3 can be found [here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/lab6_task3.cpp) 

Lab 7:_The first part to this assignment uses a nested for loop to print numbers one by one, adding onto the pre-existing list on the next line. The second part of this assignment finds all of the prime numbers in a user given range._

Lab 8:_This lab has three parts. The first part of this lab takes in an array of 5 numbers and outputs the reversed array. The second part of this lab prints out characters that are repeated in the sequence. The third part of this lab (similar to the second part) takes an array of characters from the user, but instead of printing repeated parts, it sorts it in alphabetical order._
