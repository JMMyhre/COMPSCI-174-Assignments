# This is a repository for the course work included in COMPSCI 174

## COMPSCI 174 is an introductory course to C++

### All of this work was completed by myself

## Homework
HW 1: _This homework assignment, was our first in this course. It introduced basic input and output, as well as basic variables and operators._ 
- [Find it Here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/hw1.cpp)
 
HW 2: _This homework assignment has two parts. The first part is a basic income calculator, it takes in the amount of each type of seat at a sports game sold, and calculates the total income from the seats. The second part has a similar idea, it takes in the total number of tickets sold in a movie and calculates the gross profit for the box office as well as the distributor._

- Part 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/hw2_problem2.cpp)

HW 3: _This homework assignment has two parts. The first part is a solution calculator for a specific equation, which only takes in positive integer values. The second part of this assignment was a first look at if else statements, and was used to output a result based on how many hours you worked out that week._

- Part 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/hw3_problem2.cpp)

HW 4: _This homework assignment was our first introduction to for loops as well as arrays. This homework assignment asks the user to input numbers for both of the arrays, then scans the arrays to see if they are the same._

HW 5:_This homework assignment was a way to introduce us to functions as well as nested for loops. In part 1 we have to create a specific pyramid pattern using nested for loops. While in part 2 we had to use a function to reverse a string that we got from user input._

## Labs

Lab 3:_This lab assignment has two parts. In the first part we coded a basic conversion calculator for US currency to Canadian currency. The second part uses similar features, but takes in the number of female and male students in a class and computes the percent female and percent male in the class_
