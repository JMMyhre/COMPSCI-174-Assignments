# This is a repository for the course work included in COMPSCI 174

## COMPSCI 174 is an introductory course to C++

### All of this work was completed by myself

## Homework
HW 1: This homework assignment, was our first in this course. It introduced basic input and output, as well as basic variables and operators. 
- [Find it Here](https://github.com/JMMyhre/COMPSCI-174-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/hw1.cpp)

HW 2: This homework assignment has two parts. The first part is a basic income calculator, it takes in the amount of each type of seat at a sports game sold, and calculates the total income from the seats. The second part has a similar idea, it takes in the total number of tickets sold in a movie and calculates the gross profit for the box office as well as the distributor.
